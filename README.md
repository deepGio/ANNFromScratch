# Artificial Neural Network from Scratch

#### In this interactive Notebook we are going to:

- Build the architecture of a simple 2-layers ANN
- Generate data
- Train the network
- Test the network and evaluate metrics.

All the tasks are done using low-level Tensorflow API, to highlight the math beyond ANNs.

The notebook provides explanations and schemes to better understand all steps.  
Just make sure you have `Python 3.6` or higher, `Jupyter` and all the required dependencies  
listed in `dependencies.txt`. The first paragraph will tell you if the needed libraries are not yet installed.  

Play with controls and assign new values to Hyperparameters to see what happens to the Network Performace.
